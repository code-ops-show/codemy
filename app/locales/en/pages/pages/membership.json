        "question": "How can I learn if I'm just following along?",
        "answer": "You'll need to make the effort to understand the code being written, this is something we leave up to you. We don't recommend blindly copying the code on the screen but actively asking questions in your head like 'How does it all fit together?' or 'If i change this part I wonder what happens?'"

        "question": "How Often do you release new content?",
